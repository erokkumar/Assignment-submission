1) what is statically and dynamically typed Programming language.

sol.

There are two main differences between dynamic typing and static typing that you should be aware of when writing transformation scripts. First, dynamically-typed languages perform type checking at runtime, while statically typed languages perform type checking at compile time.

2) what is the variable in java.

sol.

Variables are containers for storing data values. In Java, there are different types of variables, for example: String - stores text, such as "Hello".

3) How to Assign a value to variable.

sol.

type variableName = value; Where type is one of Java's types (such as int or String ), and variableName is the name of the variable (such as x or name). The equal sign is used to assign values to the variable.

4) what is Primitive Data types in java.

sol.

Primitive data types - includes byte , short , int , long , float , double , boolean and char.

5) what are the identifiers in java.

sol.

Identifiers in Java are names that distinguish between different Java entities, such as classes, methods, variables, and packages.

6) List the Operators in java.

sol.

Java supports the following types of operators:
Arithmetic Operators.
Assignment Operators.
Logical Operators.
Relational Operators.
Unary Operators.
Bitwise Operators.
Ternary Operators.
Shift Operators.

7) Explain about Increment and decrement operators and give an examples.

sol.

Increment and decrement operators are unary operators that add or subtract one, to or from their operand, respectively. They are commonly implemented in imperative programming languages.
