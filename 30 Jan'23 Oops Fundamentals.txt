 Variables declared within a method are local    
 variables.

* Instance variables.
  An instance variable is declared inside a class  
  but outside of any method or block.

5) In which area memory is allocated for instance variable and local variable.

sol.

Stack is a memory place where the methods and the local variables are stored. (variable references either primitive or object references are also stored in the stack). Heap is a memory place where the objects and its instance variable are stored.

6) What is method overloading.

sol.

Method overloading in Java means having two or more methods (or functions) in a class with the same name and different arguments (or parameters).
